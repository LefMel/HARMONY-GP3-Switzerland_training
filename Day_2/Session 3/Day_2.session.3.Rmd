## Example from Veterinary Epidemiologic research, 2nd ed., Dohoo, p. 111-113    
- Test are considered conditionally independent if the probability of getting a given test results on one test does not depend on the result from the other test, given the disease status of the individual.
- If tests are conditionally independent, the formulae for $Se$ and $Sp$ under parallel $(Se_p, Sp_p)$ and series $(Se_s,Sp_s)$ interpretation are:
- $Se_p = Se_1 + Se_2 - (Se_1*Se_2)$
- $Sp_p = Sp_1*Sp_2$
- $Se_s = Se_1*Se_2$
- $Sp_s = Sp_1 + Sp_2 - (Sp_1*Sp_2)$

## Estimating covariances between test results
- Using the $Se$ and $Sp$ estimates from the ISA example, the covariances in the $D+$ and the $D-$ groups are:
    - $covar(+) = Se_s (obs) - (Se_1*Se_2) = 0.761 - 0.726 = 0.035$
    - $covar(-) = Sp_p (obs) - (Sp_1*Sp_2) = 0.930 - 0.931 = -0.001$

## Conditional dependencies
- Conditional independence implies that given an animal is diseased (or not) the probability $P$ of positive (or negative) outcomes for T\textsubscript{1}, the test results of the first test, is the same -  regardless of the known outcome for the second test, T\textsubscript{2}.

## Example of a COVID-19 data set
1. how to prepare the data set in the correct format
     * create_data_cassaniti.R
2. how to describe the model
     * model_final.bug
3. how to run the model in JAGS with runjags
     * runjags.version.R
4. how to check convergence and how to analyse the data

## Exercises
- Ex. 1
    - Can you re-run the exercises?
    - Assess what happens if you add other covariances?
    - How many could you add and still have "meaningful results"?
    - Try different priors
    - Looking at the runjags reference manual, could ou customize the plots (just showing trace plots and histograms)?
- Ex. 2 (Bonus)
    - Could you expand the model with a fourth test with simulated data?
    
    
# Exercise 3 Covariates
- Explore the data set 'echinococcus.csv'
    PCR for either E. multilocularis or E. granulosus, ELISA for both, eggs found by arecoline purgation, Tawnia co-infection, age and sex 
- Run classical 'risk factor analysis': is sex, Taenia co-infection or age a risk factor for echinococcus (PCR-prevalence, seroprevalence or purges)? Obtain p-values and ORs with confidence intervals.  

# Exercise 4 Covariates
- Prepare the data set in the correct format (dump, add ones) for BLCM
-  name it : m.short <- as.matrix(dat)
- Run a model for three tests (assume a very high sensitivity for arecoline purgation)
- Try different priors
- Evidence of conditional dependencies
- Is there evidence for a covariate effect on the prevalence?
